# Cats
App at SwiftUI that fetching random pictures from TheCatApi and showing them in small library, but best thing is SwipeView that building a stack of the pictures and allowing you to swipe cards. Everything is soothly animated and when the top card is swiped, the beneath one taking its place and whole stack is pleasantly rebuilding.
